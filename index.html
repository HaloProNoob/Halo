	<h2 id="H2">The notorious franchise known as HALO was first introduced on November 15, 2001</h2>
   <p id="P1" style="line-height: 1.5;">
	Halo Combat Evolved marked the beginning for one of the most well-known video game franchises to this day.
	However, like many different games, there have been many ups and downs for Halo. This post is based completely on my opinions and nothing else.
	I have very positive opinions for all the main HALO games, even the ones that most people would say are "bad games". 
	Sure, some of the games are objectively better than the others, but the "bad ones" still have redeeming qualities.
	One of the not so popular ones being Halo 5. I have heard many people say Halo 5 was one of the worst games in terms of storytelling, which is completely fair.
	Halo 5 does not come close to classics like Halo CE, 2, or 3. But the redeeming quality of Halo 5 would have to be it's multiplayer, having new mechanics, weapons, maps, etc.
	There's not much to say on the low points of the Halo games because to me there aren't many. I've always tried to keep an open mind about new mechanics coming out
	regarding weapons, abilities, maps and all that other good stuff. New isn't always bad, yes it's different, but different can still be a good change.

	In conclusion, Halo good
